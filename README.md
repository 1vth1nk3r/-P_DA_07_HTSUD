# Analyzing success perspectives of a small robot-run cafe 
The project from the How to Tell a Story Using Data sprint of the Practicum DA/DS course.


## Description
Here we have a dataset on restaurants in LA. We want to do market research to find out if a small robot-run cafe could succeed.

First, we should do some data preprocessing: clean the data, fill in the missing values (if any), and change data types. Also, we need to add some new columns to help our analysis. After doing so, we could explore our data.

## Conclusion
After preprocessing, we used graphical analysis to investigate the data. 

The most popular (more than half) type of establishment is a nonchain restaurant (4963 from 9651).   
The most common number of seats is less than 50. But because of some artifacts, I don't find this part of the data very reliable. 

Based on this dataset, I assume a small robot-run cafe or restaurant can succeed.

Also, it's not that uncommon for a small restaurant or cafe to be a part of a chain. Thus if the first run succeeds, we could develop this idea further.
